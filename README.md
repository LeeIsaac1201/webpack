## 1.0: Project Overview

This project is a simple starter setup that demonstrates how to use Webpack 5 to bundle a basic front-end application and how to integrate Bootstrap 5 using npm. It includes support for bundling HTML, JS, and CSS files while automatically generating the destination folder during the build process.

---

## 2.0: Prerequisites

Before installing and running the project, ensure that the following tools are already installed on the device:

- Node.js (v24.x or later): Used to run JavaScript tools and manage dependencies.
- npm (v11.x or later): Installed automatically with Node.js and required for installing packages.

To verify the versions installed, run these commands in your terminal:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

If the versions appear, you are ready to proceed.

---

## 3.0: Installation

**3.1: Create the project folder and initialise npm.** The commands used are `mkdir webpack`, `cd webpack`, and `npm init -y`.

**3.2: Install Webpack and essential tools to match “necessary dependencies” for bundling, CSS handling, and HTML generation.** The commands used are `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev` and `npm install style-loader css-loader html-webpack-plugin --save-dev`.

### 3.3: Create the source files.

Create a src/ folder with:  
`src/index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>My Bootstrap + Webpack Project</title>
  </head>
  <body class="p-5">
    <div class="container text-center">
      <h1 class="mb-4 text-primary">Hello Bootstrap + Webpack 🎉</h1>
      <button id="btn" class="btn btn-success">Click Me</button>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

`src/styles.css`:

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  background: #f8f9fa;
}
```

`src/index.js`:

```js
import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
import "bootstrap";
require("./styles.css");

const btn = document.getElementById("btn");
btn?.addEventListener("click", () => {
  const msg =
    document.getElementById("webpack-msg") ??
    (() => {
      const p = document.createElement("p");
      p.id = "webpack-msg";
      p.textContent = "Webpack is working!";
      document.body.appendChild(p);
      return p;
    })();
  msg.textContent = "Webpack is working!";
});
```

**3.4: Add the Webpack configuration** in the project root’s directory named `webpack.config.js`.  
**3.5: Add npm scripts** in package.json.

---

## 4.0: Webpack Configuration

- `style-loader` injects CSS into the Document Object Model (DOM), and css-loader allows importing CSS from JS.
- `html-webpack-plugin` creates a HTML file and auto-injects the bundled script.
- Entry/Output bundle the application into `dist/bundle.js`.

### Commands:

- `npm run build` to build the project and create `/dist`:  
- `npm start` produces the relevant links and information to open the Local Host.

---

## 5.0: Bootstrap Integration

**5.1: Install Bootstrap** using the command `npm install bootstrap`.

**5.2: Import Bootstrap in the entry file** with these lines of code in `src/index.js`:

- The **first import** bundles Bootstrap’s precompiled CSS so you can use Bootstrap classes in the HTML file.
- The **second import** bundles Bootstrap’s JavaScript components (e.g., modals, dropdowns, tooltips). They work automatically because Bootstrap includes Popper internally since version 5.

**5.3: Update index.html** to use Bootstrap classes:

**5.4: Rebuild the project** using the command `npm run build`:

**5.5: Rerun the project** using `npm start` to obtain the relevant links and information to open the Local Host:

We can now see that the Local Host is running successfully:

## 6.0: Folder Structure

**What Each Folder and File Represents**

**`dist/`**

It is an output folder when npm run build. It contains:

- bundle.js: A Webpack-bundled JavaScript.
- bundle.js.LICENSE.txt: Autogenerated license information.
- index.html: Generated by html-webpack-plugin.

**`node_modules/`**

It is automatically created by npm, and contains all installed packages such as:

- Webpack
- style-loader
- css-loader
- html-webpack-plugin
- Bootstrap

The folder should never be edited manually. It is regenerated entirely when npm install

**`src/`**

The actual application source code:

- `index.html`: Starting HTML template.
- `index.js`: Entry point for Webpack (imports the CSS and Bootstrap; handles button logic).
- `styles.css`: Custom styles.

**package.json and package-lock.json**

Dependency configuration:

- package.json: Metadata, installed packages, and npm scripts.
- package-lock.json: Locks exact dependency versions.

**webpack.config.js**

The Webpack configuration, including:

- Entry point
- Output settings
- Loaders for CSS
- HTML plugin configuration

## 7.0: Running the Project

After completing the installation, Webpack setup, and Bootstrap integration, the project can be run in two modes, development and production.

**7.1: Start the Development Server**

Use Webpack Dev Server to run the project locally with live reloading:

`npm start`

This serves your bundled files and automatically reloads the page whenever you update your source code.

The project will be available at: [http://localhost:8081/](http://localhost:8081/)

**7.2: Build for Production**

To generate an optimised, production-ready bundle inside the dist/ folder, run:

`npm run build`

This command:

- Bundles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Minimises and optimises the output.
- Produces a clean `dist/` folder with only the necessary files.

---

## 8.0: Troubleshooting

These are some of the common issues we have encountered and the solutions to resolve them.

**8.1: “Module parse failed: import/export may appear only with sourceType: module”**

Cause: The project is using CommonJS (require) instead of ES modules (import) in Webpack.

Solution: Use require (“./styles.css”) for CSS imports or convert the whole project to ESM.

**8.2: Dev Server Not Starting**

Cause: If the error message **npm ERR! Missing script: "dev"** appears, this means that the script does not exist in package.json.

Solution: Use `npm start`, as the project uses `"start": "webpack serve --mode development"`.

**8.3: “Module Not Found” Errors**

Verify that the paths are correct and case-sensitive:

Correct: `src/styles.css`

Incorrect: `src/Styles.css`

Also, ensure that all files exist exactly as referenced.
